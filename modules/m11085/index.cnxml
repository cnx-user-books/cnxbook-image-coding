    We now consider statistical characteristics of typical images
    which can permit compression. If all images comprised dots with
    uncorrelated random intensities, then each pel would need to be
    coded independently and we could not achieve any useful
    gains. However typical images are very different from random dot
    patterns and significant compression gains are possible.
    </para>  

    <para id="para2">
      Some compression can be achieved even if no additional
      distortion is permitted (<term>lossless coding</term>) but much
      greater compression is possible if some additional distortion is
      allowed (<term>lossy coding</term>). Lossy coding is the main
      topic of this course but we try to keep the added distortions
      near or below the human <link document="m11084" target-id="sec3" strength="3">visual sensitivity</link> thresholds discussed
      previously.

    <para id="para3">
      Statistical characteristics of signals can often be most readily
      appreciated by frequency domain analysis since the power
      spectrum is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation
      function. The 2-D FFT is a convenient tool for analysing
      images. <link target-id="figure1" strength="2"/> shows the

      spectrum. Zero frequency is at the centre of the spectrum image
      and the log scale shows the lower spectral components much more
      clearly.

      The bright region near the centre of the spectrum shows that the
      main concentration of image energy is at low frequencies, which
      implies strong correlation between nearby pels and is typical of
      real-world images. The diagonal line of spectral energy at about
      -30Â° is due to the strong diagonal edges of the hat normal
      to this direction. Similarly the near-horizontal spectral line
      comes from the strong near-vertical stripe of hair to the right
      of the face. Any other features are difficult to distinguish in
      this global spectrum.

    <para id="para5">   
      A key property of real-world images is that their statistics are
      not stationary over the image. <link target-id="figure2" strength="2"/> demonstrates this by splitting the 'Lenna' image
      into 64 blocks of

      </m:math> pels, and calculating the Fourier log power spectrum
      of each block. The wide variation in spectra is clearly
      seen. Blocks with dominant edge directions produce spectra with
      lines normal to the edges, and those containing the feathers of
      the hat generate a broad spread of energy at all
      frequencies. However a bright centre, indicating dominant low
      frequency components, is common to all blocks.

    <para id="para6">
      We conclude that in many regions of a typical image, most of the
      signal energy is contained in a relatively small number of
      spectral components, many of which are at low
      frequencies. However, between regions, the location of the main
      components changes significantly.
    </para>

    <para id="para7">
      <emphasis>The concentration of spectral energy is the key to
      compression. If a signal can be reconstructed from its Fourier
      transform, and many of the transform coefficients are very
      small, then a close approximation to the original can be
      reconstructed from just the larger transform coefficients, so
      only these coefficients need be transmitted</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para id="para8">
      In practice, the Fourier transform is not very suitable for
      compression because it generates complex coefficients and it is
      badly affected by discontinuities at block boundaries (half-sine
      windowing was used in <link target-id="figure1" strength="3"/> and
      <link target-id="figure2" strength="3"/> to reduce boundary effects
      but this would prevent proper reconstruction of the image). In
      <link document="m11087" strength="3">further discussion</link>, we
      demonstrate the principles of image compression using the Haar
      transform, perhaps the simplest of all transforms.
