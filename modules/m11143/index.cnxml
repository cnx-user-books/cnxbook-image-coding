      Motion estimation is the processes which generates the motion
      vectors that determine how each motion compensated prediction
      frame is created from the previous frame.

    <para id="para2">
      <term>Block Matching</term> (BM) is the most common method of
      motion estimation.  Typically each macroblock (
      <m:math>
	<m:apply>
	  <m:times/>
	  <m:cn>16</m:cn>
	  <m:cn>16</m:cn>
	</m:apply>
      </m:math> pels) in the new frame is compared with shifted
      regions of the same size from the previous decoded frame, and
      the shift which results in the minimum error is selected as the
      best motion vector for that macroblock.  The motion compensated
      prediction frame is then formed from all the shifted regions
      from the previous decoded frame.
    </para>
    
    <para id="para3">
      BM can be very computationally demanding if all shifts of each
      macroblock are analysed.  For example, to analyse shifts of up
      to
      <m:math>
	<m:apply>
	  <m:mo>Â±</m:mo>
	  <m:cn>15</m:cn>
	</m:apply>
      </m:math> pels in the horizontal <emphasis>and</emphasis>
      vertical directions requires
      <m:math>
	<m:apply>
	  <m:eq/>
	  <m:apply>
	    <m:times/>
	    <m:cn>31</m:cn>
	    <m:cn>31</m:cn>
	  </m:apply>
	  <m:cn>961</m:cn>
	</m:apply>
      </m:math> shifts, each of which involves 
      <m:math>
	<m:apply>
	  <m:eq/>
	  <m:apply>
	    <m:times/>
	    <m:cn>16</m:cn>
	    <m:cn>16</m:cn>
	  </m:apply>
	  <m:cn>256</m:cn>
	</m:apply>
      </m:math> pel difference computations for a given macroblock.
      This is known as <term>exhaustive search BM</term>.
    </para>

    <para id="para4">
      Significant savings can be made with <term>hierarchical
      BM</term>, in which an approximate motion estimate is obtained
      from exhaustive search using a lowpass subsampled pair of
      images, and then the estimate is refined by a small local search
      using the full resolution images.  Subsampling 2:1 in each
      direction reduces the number of macroblock pels
      <emphasis>and</emphasis> the number of shifts by 4:1, producing
      a computational saving of 16:1!
    </para>

    <para id="para5">
      There are many other approaches to motion estimation, some using
      the frequency or wavelet domains, and designers have considered
      scope to invent new methods since this process does not need to
      be specified in coding standards.  The standards need only
      specify how the motion vectors should be interpreted by the
      decoder (a much simpler process).  Unfortunately, we do not have
      time to discuss these other approaches here.
